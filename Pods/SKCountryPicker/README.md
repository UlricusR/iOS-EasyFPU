## Installation

CountryPicker is available through Cocoapods and Carthage.

#### [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org):
Add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
For supporting iOS 15 or below 
pod 'SKCountryPicker'

For iOS 15 and above (Combine and Swiftui version) currently only supported by cocoapods 
pod 'SKCountryPicker', :git => 'https://github.com/SURYAKANTSHARMA/CountryPicker', :branch => 'iOS15AndAbove'

```

Please note iOS 15 will be discontinued after in 2024. 
#### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
The steps required to use Carthage for dependency management are described [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#getting-started) but lets add them to this README as well for good measure.

First you need to add the following line to your Cartfile

```
github "SURYAKANTSHARMA/CountryPicker"
```

to include the latest version of CountryPicker.

(if you don't have a Cartfile, you need to create one first in your favorite texteditor)

Next run

```
carthage update --platform iOS
```

This will have Carthage:
- Fetch the source code for CountryPicker from Github
- Compile the source code into a framework for you to use

once Carthage finishes building, you need to add the framework to your project.

In Xcode:

- Navigate to the "General" tab of your project and tap the plus sign under "Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Content"
- Select "Add other" and locate the Carthage folder (typically in the root of your project)
- The SKCountryPicker.framework is located under `Carthage/Build/iOS/`
- Select it and verify that it is added as a framework.

The final step is to add the `copy-frameworks` build script to your "Build Phases".

- Navigate to "Build Phases" and tap the + at the top.
- Select "New Run Script Phase"
- Paste this line as the script to run `/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks`
- Add the SKCountryPicker.framework under Input Files like so: `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/SKCountryPicker.framework`

Done!

#### [SPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

Add the following line to your Package.swift file in the dependencies section:

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/SURYAKANTSHARMA/CountryPicker.git, from "1.2.7")
```

## Getting Started
Please  check [baseiOS11Example](https://github.com/SURYAKANTSHARMA/CountryPicker/tree/master/Examples) project for customization and different option available for using with old uikit.

Please check [baseiOS15Example](https://github.com/SURYAKANTSHARMA/CountryPicker/tree/master/CountryPickeriOS15%2B/CountryPicker13%2BExample) project for using it in swift ui app with minimum deployment target iOS 15


## Filter Options
There are 3 main filter options `countryName`, `countryCode`, `countryDialCode` and  by default country picker has been configured to filter countries based on `countryName`.

If you want to add/remove filter options, do as follows:
```swift

 // Adding filter
 CountryManager.shared.addFilter(.countryCode)

 // Removing filter
 CountryManager.shared.removeFilter(.countryCode)

 // Removing all filters
 CountryManager.shared.clearAllFilters()
```

Incase you want to retrieve  `country` info
```swift

// Get country based on digit code e.g: 60, +255
CountryManager.shared.country(withDigitCode: "255")

// Get country based on country name
CountryManager.shared.country(withName: "Tanzania")

// Get country based on country code e.g: MY, TZ
CountryManager.shared.country(withCode: "MY")

```
