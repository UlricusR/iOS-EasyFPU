## Disclaimer

!!! warning

    I need and want to emphasize that the use of this app is on your own risk!

The Fat-Protein-Units and absorption time calculated by this app are based on the recommendations of nutrition scientific articles, see list of links on this page. The app calculates FPUs by taking the total calories of a food item and subtracting the calories based on carbs (4 kcal/g). The difference represents the calories based on fat and proteins. For more details, please refer to the chapter on the absorption scheme.
