## Sample Data

You may download [this JSON file](assets/fpu_calculator_database.json) with some sample food items (food names and typical amounts are in German mainly). Import it via the main menu (Import database from JSON).

However, I strongly recommend to add your own food items, as e.g. typical amounts vary from person to person.
