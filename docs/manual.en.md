## The Main Screen with the Food List

![The main screen with the food list](assets/images/01_FoodList.png){style="width:100px", align=right }

The main screen appears when opening the app and contains a list of food items. It will be empty after first installation - after updating the app, the existing list will be taken over.

A food item in the sense of this app represents one component of a meal, which is „homogenous“ in itself. Several food items make up a meal. For example: A Schnitzel with French Fries and Ketchup (the meal) consists of the Schnitzel, the Fries and Ketchup (the food items).

The food list on the main screen is sorted in alphabetical order. It is recommended to assign unique names to each food item and not repeat existing names, although the app won‘t hinder you to do so.

![The food list filtered by favorites](assets/images/02_FoodList-filtered.png){style="width:100px", align=left }

When clicking the small star in the top right corner of the food list, only food items marked as favorites will be displayed. Favorites can be defined in the Edit Food dialog. Furthermore you may search for food using the search field (any string in the food name).

Long pressing a food item opens the dialog to edit the food item.

Swipe left to delete a food item.

## Sample Data

You may download [this JSON file](assets/fpu_calculator_database.json) with some sample food items (food names and typical amounts are in German mainly). Import it via the main menu (Import database from JSON).

However, I strongly recommend to add your own food items, as e.g. typical amounts vary from person to person.
